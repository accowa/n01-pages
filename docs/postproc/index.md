# Post-processing tips
ARCHER2 has 128-core, exclusive use nodes but no serial nodes for post-processing

How do we make best use of the nodes for serial tasks? E.g.:

 * [Compressing and chunking ‘one_file’ output](./ncks_example.md)
 * [Rebuilding and chunking ‘multiple_file’ output](./rebuild_nemo_example.md)


What is the best way to run multiple, small-scale parallel tasks? E.g.:

 * [Running reproducibility tests](./repro_example.md)
 * Running ensembles of small to medium configurations
